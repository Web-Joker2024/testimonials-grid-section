    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, 
    in the company I joined. I <br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

  <div class="testimonial">  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
    for <br>
    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
    The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
    the course, I’ve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</div>

  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from<br>
   their experiences was easy.
</div>
<div class="testimonial"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</div>

  Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
</div>
<div class="testimonial testimonial-excep">  
  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>
   never written a line of code. I needed<br>
    some structure from 
  professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
  student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff 
  did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>  and I never had to wait long for<br>  assistance. The agile team 
  project, in<br>  particular, was outstanding. It took<br>  my learning to the next level in a way<br>  that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In<br>  fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>  interviews as an example of my<br>  developent 
  experience. It certainly<br>  helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>  developer after receiving multiple<br>  offers. 
  100% recommend! ”
